# Ray Tracing

A personal learning project to learn Ray Tracing from [The Cherno's Ray Tracing Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98edc5GshdBtREv5asFW3yXl).

## Building and running
Officially supports Windows 10/11 and Visual Studio 2022, with more platforms coming soon. You'll need to have the [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/) installed.

1. Clone recursively: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/an1n-dya/RayTracing`
2. Run `scripts/Setup.bat`
3. Open `RayTracing.sln` and hit F5 (preferably change configuration to Release or Dist first, Debug is slow)
